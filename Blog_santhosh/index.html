Here are other compelling reasons that photography is more than just a craft : </p>
            <p>1) Photography requires imagination and creativity </p>
            <p>2) Photography captures emotions </p>
            <p>3) Photography required analytical skills </p>
            <p>4) Photographers understand physics </p>
            <p>5) Photographers understand abstraction </p>
